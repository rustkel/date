# date

Simple rust module to work with dates.

Calculates leap years according to standard Gregorian (>1582 AD) and Julian calendars, and counts days between dates.

Does not use the std library (only to implement Display).

Not optimised for speed; rather, it's more an exercise to show some Rust patterns such as *match* and *struct*.
